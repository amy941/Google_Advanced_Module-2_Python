## Scenario: 
Constructing a dataframe in Python for data learning, future Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.

## What I Learned:
**1) Imports and data loading:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```python
data = pd.read_csv("tiktok_dataset.csv")
```
✍️ Importing NumPy and Panda packages, then load dataset from CSV file to a dataframe.

---
**2) Inspect the data:**
```python
data.head(10)
data.info()
data.describe()
```

![head()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77200b7a-3eca-486b-af2e-1171fc5f1b65)

✍️ *.head()* is used to display a few first rows of df. Reviewing the first few rows, we can tell **df contains different data types (str, int, floats).** Each row represents a distinct TikTok video with comments and statuses. 


![info()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/145e3092-8493-4ed5-969a-2dcd6c8ed669)

✍️ *.info()* is for summary info. The output shows df contains **5 floats, 3 integers, and 4 objects.** Total video counts is **19382 videos**. There are some **missing values** in variables as ```claim_status```, ```video_transcription_text```, and all ```count``` variables.


![describe()](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c234a9d-8059-45f4-b39a-8381b3be542a)

✍️ *.describe()* is for descriptive statistics summary. **Many 'count' variables have outliers.**

---
**3) Investigate the variables:**

```python
claims = data[data['claim_status'] == 'claim']

print('MEAN view count claims: ', claims['video_view_count'].mean())
print('MEDIAN view count claims: ', claims['video_view_count'].median())
```

![claims](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c15340e5-3f41-40f4-9e6f-f2434da4f6ab)

✍️ First, examine the amount of videos for each different claim status (claims vs. opinions).
Next, create **BOOLEAN masking** to *filter* the data according to claim status, then determine **MEAN** and **MEDIAN** view counts for each claim status. 

**- Step 1:** Assign a **dataframe** called ```claims```.

**- Step 2:** Write a logical statement: ```data['claim_status'] == 'claim'``` The objective is to keep status as **claim** only and filter out the rest. This is called **BOOLEAN MASKING**. The output will result in **True or False** value in a **Series** object. To apply this mask to dataframe, simply insert this statement into **selector brackets [ ]** and apply it to dataframe, like this: ```data[data['claim_status'] == 'claim']```

**- Step 3:** After filtering df to include only the ```claims```, output the statistical values using *.mean()* and *.median()* method.
  
🔁 Repeat the same steps for ```opinions``` status.

```python
opinions = data[data['claim_status'] == 'opinion']

print('MEAN view count opinions: ', opinions['video_view_count'].mean())
print('MEDIAN view count opinions: ', opinions['video_view_count'].median())
```

![opinions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ccba3a3-1459-4d77-a3a5-99f065789bf1)

---
**4) Grouping and Aggregation:**

```python
data.groupby(['claim_status', 'author_ban_status']).agg({
    'likes_per_view': ['count', 'mean', 'median'],
    'comments_per_view': ['count', 'mean', 'median'],
    'shares_per_view': ['count', 'mean', 'median']
})
```

![groupby](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d722f2bf-ad36-4ba8-a568-84e8faf21183)

✍️ **groupby()** was called directly on df. The data was grouped first by ```'claim_status'```, then by ```'author_ban_status'```. Then, the **agg()** function was applied to calculate the **count**, **mean**, and **median** for the three newly created columns: ```likes_per_view```, ```comments_per_view```, and ```shares_per_view```.
